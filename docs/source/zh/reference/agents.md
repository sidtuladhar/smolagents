# Agents

<Tip warning={true}>

Smolagents is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents
can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change.

</Tip>

To learn more about agents and tools make sure to read the [introductory guide](../index). This page
contains the API docs for the underlying classes.

## Agents

Our agents inherit from [`MultiStepAgent`], which means they can act in multiple steps, each step consisting of one thought, then one tool call and execution. Read more in [this conceptual guide](../conceptual_guides/react).

We provide two types of agents, based on the main [`Agent`] class.
  - [`CodeAgent`] is the default agent, it writes its tool calls in Python code.
  - [`ToolCallingAgent`] writes its tool calls in JSON.

Both require arguments `model` and list of tools `tools` at initialization.

## Models

You're free to create and use your own models to power your agent.

You could use any `model` callable for your agent, as long as:
1. It follows the [messages format](./chat_templating) (`List[Dict[str, str]]`) for its input `messages`, and it returns a `str`.
2. It stops generating outputs *before* the sequences passed in the argument `stop_sequences`

For defining your LLM, you can make a `custom_model` method which accepts a list of [messages](./chat_templating) and returns text. This callable also needs to accept a `stop_sequences` argument that indicates when to stop generating.

```python
from huggingface_hub import login, InferenceClient

login("<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>")

model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"

client = InferenceClient(model=model_id)

def custom_model(messages, stop_sequences=["Task"]) -> str:
    response = client.chat_completion(messages, stop=stop_sequences, max_tokens=1000)
    answer = response.choices[0].message.content
    return answer
```

Additionally, `custom_model` can also take a `grammar` argument. In the case where you specify a `grammar` upon agent initialization, this argument will be passed to the calls to model, with the `grammar` that you defined upon initialization, to allow [constrained generation](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/conceptual/guidance) in order to force properly-formatted agent outputs.

### TransformersModel

For convenience, we have added a `TransformersModel` that implements the points above by building a local `transformers` pipeline for the model_id given at initialization.

```python
from smolagents import TransformersModel

model = TransformersModel(model_id="HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M-Instruct")

print(model([{"role": "user", "content": "Ok!"}], stop_sequences=["great"]))
```
```text
>>> What a
```

> [!TIP]
> You must have `transformers` and `torch` installed on your machine. Please run `pip install smolagents[transformers]` if it's not the case.

### HfApiModel

The `HfApiModel` wraps an [HF Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) client for the execution of the LLM.

```python
from smolagents import HfApiModel

messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing great. How can I help you today?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "No need to help, take it easy."},
]

model = HfApiModel()
print(model(messages))
```
```text
>>> Of course! If you change your mind, feel free to reach out. Take care!
```

### LiteLLMModel

The `LiteLLMModel` leverages [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) to support 100+ LLMs from various providers.
You can pass kwargs upon model initialization that will then be used whenever using the model, for instance below we pass `temperature`.

```python
from smolagents import LiteLLMModel

messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing great. How can I help you today?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "No need to help, take it easy."},
]

model = LiteLLMModel("anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest", temperature=0.2, max_tokens=10)
print(model(messages))
```
